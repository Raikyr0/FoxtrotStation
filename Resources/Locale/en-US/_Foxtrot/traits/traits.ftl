trait-name-LesserBionicArm = Mid-Grade Bionic Arm
trait-description-LesserBionicArm =
    One or more of your limbs have been replaced with a moderately-priced, state of the art bionic. It could be either one made of highly realistic synthflesh,
    or a more obvious metal limb. This limb provides enhanced strength to its user, allowing one to more easily pry open unpowered barriers without tools.
